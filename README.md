# J. Collins' RAM Research and Development Database

### What is this?
This is just a collection of RAM addresses I've found across various video games.  Mostly old ones.

### How did you do this?
Debuggers, RAM search, et cetera.

### Why share it?
This is mostly useful for making cheats, but can be back-traced to make permanent changes to games, as well.

### Are you going to release anything?
Just text files.  No actual code.
