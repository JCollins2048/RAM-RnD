# J. Collins' RAM Research and Development Database

### What is this?
This is just a collection of RAM addresses I've found across various video games.  Mostly old ones.

### How did you do this?
Using emulators, debuggers, RAM searches, and other reverse-engineering techniques.

### Why share it?
This is mostly useful for making "cheat" or "patch" code.

With a little work, these addresses can also be back-traced to their ROM values and used to modify games permanently if desired.

### Are you going to release anything?
Just text files.  No actual code.

### Can we contribute?
This repo is mostly for things I'm interested in at a given time. I'd recommend joining the *[Data Crystal](https://datacrystal.tcrf.net/wiki/Data_Crystal)* Wiki if you're looking to contribute to an existing project.

Sidenote: If you submit any of the findings of this repository to another repository or website, a mention of this repo isn't strictly necessary (I'm just poking values), but it would be appreciated.
