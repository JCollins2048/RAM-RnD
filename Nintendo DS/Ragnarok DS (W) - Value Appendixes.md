#### Notes
- The numbers for equipment jump around because almost every item has variant clones:
- Each weapon has **five versions** with **0 Card Slots** up to **4 Card Slots**.
- Each wearable has **two versions** with **0 or 1 Card Slot**.
- Arrows can never have Card Slots, thus have **no variants**.
- The Slotted versions of many items are not accessible in normal gameplay — including Sierra's Headdress hat.
- The Headdress cannot be removed from Sierra, but if modded in, can be worn by any Shaman and grants 2 Defense and 5 Resistance.
- Sierra's version does not have a Card Slot, but a Slotted version exists.

#### Notes
- Forcing other story characters to be **any male Job** will work fine, but **certain female Jobs** crash the game:
- **Sierra** - All except Acolyte, Priest, Taekwon Master, and Shaman (available Job)
- **Lucifi** - All except Swordsman and Knight (available Job, wrong gender), Taekwon Master, and Dark Knight
- **Viselc** - All except Assassin (available Job, wrong gender) and Taekwon Master
- **Lisir** - All except Magician and Wizard (available Jobs), Taekwon Master, and Shaman (…?)
- It's possible to make a guild recruit into a Novice, but it's clear they were never meant to be recruited:
- Novices have no Party Commands, but otherwise function normally.
- They learn both Novice Attack up to Rank 8 and First Aid, but never use the latter.
- They focus their Stat Points on Strength and Agility.
- Novice recruits **cannot Change Job** despite the Job Level requirement for Novices being 10 rather than 30.
- While they can never progress beyond Job Level 10, if modded to Job Level 30, they *can* change into **Taekwon Kids** — at which point, they act like ordinary Taekwon Kid recruits.
- Since they're never meant to change jobs, Novices have no "upgrade" text strings, so the game overlaps the nearest relevant text block: "Save unsuccessful", over the "Change job class?" and "Job changed" texts.
